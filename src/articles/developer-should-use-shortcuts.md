Another thing that requires some expertise is code navigation.  
It takes a long time to understand what the code does, and it doesn't help that at first whatever you wrote is garbage. 
When you finally learn how to write acceptable code you will have to navigate even more.
And as good code has small classes you should be going back and forth between different files a lot.
The first way of doing it is by using the mouse. 
It works well for a lot of things, so why not using it also here?
Well, it actually doesn't work that well.
You are going back and forth between keyboard and mouse, once again deconcentrating about what you are doing. 
Searching for an icon that was moved in the last update (or that for some reason it was decided that it should disappear). 
If you use shortcuts you could avoid all this problems. 
You are going to the realm of power users, so be careful about it.
You could achieve a lot more with a few keypresses.
