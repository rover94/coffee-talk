			<h2>Boy scout rule</h2>
			<p>
				As a developer I've been reading a lot of articles and books throughout the years and there is one rule that stuck with me, The Boy Scout Rule.
				Most of the people are familiar with it, but let me spell it once again, just to be sure to be on the same page.
				"Always leave the code cleaner than you found it."
				As a boy scout myself, I do prefer the original version, "Always leave the world better than you found it".
			</p>

			<p>
				What this phrase entitles is that whenever you do and wherever you go, you should thrive to improve the situation a bit.
				For a boy scout, it means to help someone or remove some thrash or similar things. 
				Usually a small thing, sometimes could also be something bigger.  
				As a developer it means to slightly refactor the code to improve it, change a variable name to hold a better meaning or even just to optimize the imports. 
				Some little change that may have a bigger impact in the future. 
			</p>

			<p>
				This thinking is accepted throughout most of the developers world, but not everywhere.
				Another motto that is also used as the complete opposite, and it's actually pretty dangerous when used extensively, is "If it works, don't touch it."
				Let's compare the two. 
			</p>

			<p>
				You are out there, in the wilds lands of repos, and you encounter some bad-mannered function that is tricky to understand.
				You are supposed to track a bug, and it's most probably in there but, for the love of God, you do not get it.
				Probably I need to spend some more time in there and I will sure figure it out. 
				You take out a notepad and a pen and little by little you figure out what's happening in there.
				Apparently you aren't checking for a particular corner case on the 25th line, and on the 45th it breaks.
				Well, let's check this new condition and we are done. 
				Less than one line of code, no tests needed, because it can hardly happen inside the code base, and we are done. 
			</p>

				Since we all are good boys, and girls, let's look at the boy scout rule. 
				You are out there, in the wilds lands of repos, and you encounter some bad-mannered function that is tricky to understand.
				You are supposed to track a bug, and it's most probably in there but, for the love of God, you do not get it.
				One small check, and yes, there are some unit tests, and you have a high coverage.
				It's possible to refactor it.
				But your ticket says that you have to find the bug and fix it, not go around and change the code, what the hell are you doing?
				Well, the choice is simple. 
				You can spend two hours to understand why your code is breaking, or spend two hours to improve the code and in the meanwhile understand why it breaks. 
				To me, it sounds like two birds with one stone.
				It's also worth to consider that if someone will have to read this code again it's improved, even if slightly.
			</p>

			<p>
				The same approach could be used for all aspects of the company. 
				From the code reviews that are not going smoothly, to endless or pointless meetings, to tickets with no value.
				You can change it, slowly and one small step at a time, but you can.
				Try to be the change that you want to see in your workplace.
