# Developers should learn how to properly use keyboards

Well, I love to complain about people and various things, so I will take some time for actually do it in a more proficient way. 
I've been writing code for 15 years(God almighty I'm old). 
At first as a student and then professionaly and there is one thing that could be universally accepted, it's difficult to edit code.

Captain obvious, as some people could say, but bear with me for a moment.
I'm not talking about writing code and the logic that you're supposed to implement.
I'm talking about the physical act of writing.
You have your 26 letters spread out on a keyboard in front of you, add to that the numbers and add a few symbols you don't use every day.
Well, I have to say that at the beginning I was seriously confused. 
Then, slowly, you start to know where the letters are located and things start to go better and you think you can do this.

A lot of people stop there. 
You can write, you can delete and, well, most of the time you spend it on reading anyway, right?
What more could I want?
Touch typing.
Maybe you don't know about it or never really cared about i but it sure is the one step that really differentiate people.

You spend some time writing and deleting code. 
Every time you type something you are looking down. 
You do not know how to touch type so it's natural that you're searching for some keys.
But every time you aren't looking at screen you may have typed something wrong and will not know about it until you do.
When you finally discover your mistake you will have to go back and fix it. 
If you saw it because it could be that it's not something easy to spot.
And, well, this could happen any moment and some basic change may require a lot of time simply because you have to go back and forth.

Let's also be honest. 
You are typing, you're looking down.
What do you see?
The letters that you are missing?
The solution to the world hunger?
No, you're looking at the back of your hands. 
There is really nothing interesting there.

Let's also look at some numbers. 
Some people can type with only two fingers (some call it pecking) and reach good results.
I saw some posts on reddit where people reached good results around 70 or 80 wpm, words per minute. 
Good results with touch typing means that you can type over 100 wpm. 
The current record is hold by [Barbara Blackburn]("barbara_blackburn") that was able to reach the speed of 212 wpm. 

Lastly, it takes a really small time to learn touch typing, just try to [google it]("googleIt").
A few hours to learn the keys and a few weeks to get used to it.
And is cool. And professional. 
So, for god's sake, learn how to do it.
