# Bosses are not useless

I'm a developer, I know how to do things and I don't need any manager. At least that's what I always thought until someone pointed it out for me. "It's great that you know how to do, but WHAT are you supposed to be doing?". Usually there are a few people that tells you what the most important features are supposed to be so there is never a shortage, but what if they are not around?

You may not believe it but I never actually asked myself that. You don't really see a problem until you are actually in one. Sadly both things arrived to me a few months back. My company restructored the teams and I became the senior developer in a team of 3 juniors and we are supposed to have the tech lead guiding us. This doesn't sound so bad but, 3 months in and we never spoked with our project manager and we had an hour call with our supposed ux designer (I say supposed as I remember a different person responsible for the project). 

I may sound a bit dramatic but here is the best part "the project should be live in 2 weeks time". I knew about this deadline only a month before it. 

Our only manager, the tech lead, decided that instead of writing tickets for us to work on, it would be better to write the code himself. He follow two teams, he doesn't have time to write user stories for us but he found time to write 6k lines of untested code that should be in the initial release. 

Managers are important and, as most things in life, you really start missing them when you don't have them. 
A good manager can make you work twice the amount of time without effort.
A good manager can unblock you in any situation.
A good manager can provide you enough details for working a month and enough activities for 3 months of work. All the time.
A good manager is like having two legs. You don't feel amazing while walking, but if you can't walk suddendly you remember how splendid it was running aroudn
