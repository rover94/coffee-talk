# Developers should learn how to properly use keyboards

I love to complain about people and various things so I will take some time for actually do it in a more proficient way. 
As people say: "if you are good at something, don't do it for free" or at least "if you are good at something, al least get credit for it". 

I've been writing code for 15 years(God almighty I'm old). 
At first as a student and then professionaly and there is one thing that could be universally accepted, it's difficult to navigate and edit.

Oh good you are soo good, such a deep thought. You are so smart... 
Captain obvious, as some people could say, but bear with me for a moment.
I'm not talking about writing code and the logic that you're supposed to implement, I'm talking about the physical act of writing.
You have your 26 letters spread out on a keyboard in front of you, add to that the numbers and add a few symbols you don't use every day.
Well, I have to say that at the beginning I was seriously confused. 
Then, slowly, you start to know where the letters are located and things start to go better and you think you can do this.

A lot of people stop there. 
You can write, you can delete and, well, most of the time you spend it on reading anyway, right?
What more could I want?
Touch typing.
Maybe you don't know but it sure is the one step that really differentiate people.

You spend your time writing and deleting code. 
Every time you do, if you don't know how to touch type, you are looking down. 
And every time you do you aren't looking at the screen and if you typed something wrong you will not know.
When you discover it you will have to go back and you may break your flow.
And, well, this could happen any time and some basic change may require a lot of time simply because you have to go back and forth.

Another thing that requires some expertise is code navigation.  
It takes a long time to understand what the code does, and it doesn't help that at first whatever you wrote is garbage. 
When you finally learn how to write acceptable code you will have to navigate even more.
And as good code has small classes you should be going back and forth between different files a lot.
The first way of doing it is by using the mouse. 
It works well for a lot of things, so why not using it also here?
Well, it actually doesn't work that well.
You are going back and forth between between keyboard and mouse, once again deconcentrating about what you are doing. 
Searching for an icon that was moved in the last update (or that for some reason it was decided that it should disappear). 
If you use shortcuts you could avoid all this problems. 
You are going to the realm of power users, so be careful about it.
You could achieve a lot more with a few keypresses.

Lastly, it takes a really small time to learn touch typing. And is cool. And professional. 
So, for god's sake, learn to do it.
